# Audio Engineering Discrepancy Logger
In summer 2019 I interned at National Public Radio (NPR) as a web software developer, and ended up getting the opportunity to build them a whole new web app on a MEAN stack! (MongoDB, Express JS, Angular, Node JS)
## Description
Audio engineers at NPR like to keep track of all technical difficulties that are encountered during production. Before my
time at NPR, the system in place to log incidents was running on an outdated tech-stack and wasn't as elegant as many of the users would have liked. During my internship, it was my job to update and redesign this system to be more capable and user-friendly.

Some of the main features included:
- Automatic account creation for NPR employees.
- Searching for logs that fit various criteria.
- Log creation.
- Personal subscriptions that send email or text notifications to a specific user when a log that fits certain critiera is submitted.
- Global subscription that many users can subscribe to at once
- Automatic I.T. ticket creation.
- User roles (Administrative abilites, ability to create global subscription, etc.)

The full documentation of my implementation that I shared with my team can be found in pdf form inside this repo. (It was written in Confluence and upon 
export has experienced some small formatting errors)
