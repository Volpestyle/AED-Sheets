## Description
Audio engineers at NPR like to keep track of all technical difficulties that are encountered during production. Before my
time at NPR, the system in place to log each incident was running on outdated tech and wasn't as elegant as many of the users would have liked. It quickly became my job to redesign this system to be more capable and user-friendly.

The full documentation of my implementation that I shared with my team can be found in pdf form inside this repo. (It was written in Confluence and upon export has experienced some small formatting errors)
