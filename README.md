# AED-Sheets
In summer 2019 I interned at National Public Radio (NPR) as a web software developer, and ended up getting the opportunity to build them a whole new web app with a MEAN stack!
## Description
Audio engineers at NPR like to keep track of all technical difficulties that are encountered during production. Before my
time at NPR, the system in place to log incidents was running on an outdated tech-stack and wasn't as elegant as many of the users would have liked. During my internship, it was my job to update and redesign this system to be more capable and user-friendly.

The full documentation of my implementation that I shared with my team can be found in pdf form inside this repo. (It was written in Confluence and upon 
export has experienced some small formatting errors)
